## 👋 Hi, this is Wendy

I’m a full-stack creator and growth strategist who brings ideas to life by blending product intuition, technical execution, and data-driven storytelling.

## 🧚 About Me

I'm currently **Head of Growth at an AI Agent startup**, where I lead user acquisition, product-led growth, and go-to-market strategy for AI agents.

Before diving into AI, I worked at:

- 🪞 **Ogilvy** – Drove CRM growth for Shiseido through integrated digital campaigns
- 🛒 **Alibaba** – Improved app retention and DAU via data-driven content strategy and gamified growth mechanics
- 💡 **Han’s Laser** – Led international event marketing and booth design, doubling SEO traffic and boosting global brand visibility  
- 🍶 **Moutai** – Built a B2B2C e-commerce platform from scratch and scaled product sales across online and offline channels
- 🚗 **Volkswagen** – Led in-car app development and C-end user growth, driving GMV through digital mobility campaigns 


## 🛠️ What I Do Now

- 👩‍💻 Design & develop iOS apps with SwiftUI: Please Don't, Mirrorcam, 3 Pages Daily, AI Coverletter Maker, AI Resume Revise, Newsmood
- 🌐 Build and deploy websites, [follonet](https://www.follownet.online) , [gloabal travel guide](https://www.localtravelguide.fun)
- 📈 Scale products through full-funnel growth strategy, content ops, and user psychology

## ✨ Philosophy

> I believe in **manifestation** and the **law of attraction**.  
> I build with intention, iteration, and intuition.
